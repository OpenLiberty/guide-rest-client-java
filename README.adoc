Explore how to access a simple RESTful web service and consume its resources in Java
using JSON-B and JSON-P.

== What you'll learn
artists.json
[source, json, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/resources/artists.json[]
----

You will learn how to access a REST service, serialize a Java object that contains a
list of artists and their albums, and use two different approaches to deserialize
the returned JSON resources. The first approach consists of using the JSON-B API
to directly convert JSON messages into Java objects.  The second approach consists of
using the JSON-P API to process the JSON.

The REST service that provides the artists and albums resources has already been written
for you and is accessible at the following link when the server is running http://localhost:9080/artists[http://localhost:9080/artists^]

Which responds with the [hotspot=1-32]`artists.json`

You will implement the following two endpoints using the two deserialization approaches:

* `.../artists/total` to return the total number of artists in the JSON
* `.../artists/total/<artist>` to return the total number of albums in the JSON
for the particular artist

If you are interested in learning more about REST services and how you can write them, read
https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service^].

== Starting the service

This guide is already setup with a general application. As you progress through the guide
you will make updates to the code directly, and then push updates to the server
so you can see the results.

To start the REST service, run the Maven `install` and `liberty:start-server` goals from
the `start` directory:

[role=command]
----
mvn install liberty:start-server
----

When the server is running, you can find your service at http://localhost:9080/artists[http://localhost:9080/artists^]

== Creating POJOs

Artist.java

include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/consumingrest/model/Artist.java[tags=!comment]
----

Album.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column']

include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/consumingrest/model/Album.java[tags=!comment]
----

To deserialize a JSON message, start with creating Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) that represent what
is in the JSON and whose instance members map to the keys in the JSON.

For the purpose of this guide, you are given two POJOs.
The [hotspot=7-34 file=0]`Artist` object has two instance members [hotspot=8 file=0]`name` and [hotspot=9 file=0]`albums`, 
which map to the artist name and the collection of the albums they have written. The [hotspot=6-36 file=1]`Album` object represents a 
single object within the album collection, and contains three instance members [hotspot=7 file=1]`title`, [hotspot=10 file=1]`artistName`, and [hotspot=13 file=1]`totalTracks`, which map to the album title, the artist who wrote the album, and the number of tracks the album contains.

== Introducing JSON-B and JSON-P

JSON-B is a feature introduced with Java EE 8 and strengthens Java support for JSON.
With JSON-B you directly serialize and deserialize POJOs. This API gives you a
variety of options for working with JSON resources.

In contrast, you need to use helper methods with JSON-P to process a JSON response.
This tactic is more straightforward, but it can be cumbersome with more complex classes.

JSON-B is built on top of the existing JSON-P API. JSON-B can do everything that JSON-P can do
and allows for more customization for serializing and deserializing.

=== Using JSON-B
Artist.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/consumingrest/model/Artist.java[tags=!comment]
----

JSON-B requires a POJO to have a public default no-argument constructor for deserialization
and binding to work properly.

The JSON-B engine includes a set of default mapping rules, which can be run without
any customization annotations or custom configuration. In some instances, you might
find it useful to deserialize a JSON message with only certain fields, specific
field names, or classes with custom constructors. In these cases,
annotations are necessary and recommended:

* The [hotspot=23-24]`@JsonbProperty` annotation to map JSON keys to class instance members and vice versa.
Without the use of this annotation, JSON-B will attempt to do POJO mapping, matching the keys in
the JSON to the class instance members by name. 

JSON-B will attempt to match the JSON key with a Java field or method
annotated with `@JsonbProperty` where the value in the annotation exactly
matches the JSON key.  If no annotation exists with the given JSON key, JSON-B will 
attempt to find a matching field with the same name.  If a match cannot be found, 
JSON-B will attempt to find a matching getter (for serialization) or setter 
(for de-serialization) method whose property name matches the JSON key. If no matching 
getter/setter method can be found, then serialization/de-serialization will fail
with an exception.

The Artist POJO
does not require this annotation because all instance members match the JSON keys by name.

* The [hotspot=20]`@JsonbCreator` and [hotspot=23-24]`@JsonbProperty` annotations to annotate a custom constructor.
These annotations are required for proper parameter substitution when a custom constructor is used.

* The [hotspot=12]`@JsonbTransient` annotation to define an object property that does not map to a JSON
property. While the use of this annotation is good practice, it is only necessary for serialization.

For more information on customization with JSON-B, see the http://json-b.net[official JSON-B site^].

The [hotspot=7-34 file=0]`Artist` and [hotspot=6-36 file=1]`Album` POJOs are ready for deserialization. 
Next, we'll learn to consume the JSON response from your REST service.

JSON-B is a Java API that is used to serialize Java objects to JSON messages and vice versa.

Open Liberty's JSON-B feature on Maven Central includes the JSON-B provider through transitive dependencies.
The [hotspot=89-94 file=1]`JSON-B provider` has been added as a dependency in your [hotspot file=1]`pom.xml`

The [hotspot=16-26 file=0]`consumeWithJsonb` method in the [hotspot=15-63 file=0]`Consumer` class makes a [hotspot=19 file=0]`GET` request to the
running artist service and retrieves the JSON. Then binds the JSON into an `Artist`
array, use the [hotspot=20 file=0]`Artist[]` entity type in the [hotspot=20 file=0]`readEntity` call.

=== Processing JSON using JSON-P
Consumer.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/consumingrest/Consumer.java[tags=!comment]
----

The [hotspot=28-38]`consumeWithJsonp` method makes in the [hotspot=15-63]`Consumer` class makes a [hotspot=31]`GET` request
to the running artist service and retrieves the JSON. This method then uses the
[hotspot=40-50]`collectArtists` and [hotspot=52-62]`collectAlbums` helper methods. These helper methods will
parse the JSON and collect its objects into individual POJOs. Notice that you can
use the custom constructors to create instances of `Artist` and `Album`.

== Creating additional REST resources

Now that you can consume a JSON resource you can put that data to use.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]

#Replace the `ArtistResource` class.#
`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/consumingrest/service/ArtistResource.java`
----

* The [hotspot=25-27 file=1]`getArtists` method provides the raw JSON data service that you accessed at the
beginning of this guide.

* The [hotspot=32-40 file=1]`getJsonString` method uses JSON-B to return the JSON as a string that will
be used later for testing.

* The [hotspot=45-55 file=1]`getTotalAlbums` method uses JSON-B to return the total number of albums present
in the JSON for a particular artist. The method returns -1 if this artist does not exist.

* The [hotspot=60-63 file=1]`getTotalArtists` method uses JSON-P to return the total number of artists
present in the JSON.

The methods that you wrote in the [hotspot=15-63 file-0]`Consumer` class could be written directly in the
[hotspot=18-65 file=1]`ArtistResource` class. However, if you are consuming a REST resource from a third
party service, you should separate your `GET`/`POST` requests from your data consumption.

Maven finds and executes all tests under `it/` and each test method must be marked with the [hotspot=44 hotspot=64 hotspot=79 hotspot=90]`@Test` annotation.

You can use the [hotspot=27]`@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass` annotations to perform any one time setup and teardown
tasks before and after all of your tests execute, as well as the [hotspot=34]`@Before` and [hotspot=39]`@After` annotations
to do the same but for each individual test case.

=== Testing the binding process

For your test classes to have access to JSON-B, the [hotspot=89-94 file=1]`yasson` dependency has been added in your `pom.xml`.

The [hotspot=45-62 file=0]`testArtistDeserialization` test case checks that `Artist` instances created from
the REST data and those that are hardcoded perform the same.

The [hotspot=105-107 file=0]`assertResponse` helper method ensures that the response code you receive is valid (200).

=== Processing with JSON-B test

The [hotspot=65-77]`testJsonBAlbumCount` and [hotspot=80-88]`testJsonBAlbumCountForUnknownArtist` tests both use the `total/{artist}`
endpoint which invokes JSON-B.

The [hotspot=65-77]`testJsonBAlbumCount` test case checks that deserialization with JSON-B was done correctly
and that the correct number of albums is returned for each artist in the JSON.

The [hotspot=80-88]`testJsonBAlbumCountForUnknownArtist` test case is similar to [hotspot=65-77]`testJsonBAlbumCount`
but instead checks an artist that does not exist in the JSON and ensures that a
value of '-1' is returned.

=== Processing with JSON-P test

The [hotspot=91-100]`testJsonPArtistCount` test uses the `total` endpoint which invokes JSON-P. This test
checks that deserialization with JSON-P was done correctly and that the correct number
of artists is returned.
